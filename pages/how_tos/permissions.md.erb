How to set up permissions for your org and teams


Org level permissions:

- org admins can set up agents, no one else

Team level permissions:

- agents don't respect teams (can't have an agent only for some teams etc)
- limiting access to pipelines and what they can do with those
- read/write/build permissions, can be one, two, or all of these for different purposes, these are per pipeline inside a team


- default teams for new users
- can invite people to a team
- everyone in a team has the same permissions (except the maintainer), to do more fine grained, add more teams
- maintainer can add and remove people and pipelines from their team (as long as they have access to the pipeline in another team)
